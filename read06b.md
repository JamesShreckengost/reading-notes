    ## Introduction how computes work
        - how informatioin is represented
        - 4 parts of a computer
        - software controls hardware
    ## How Computers Work: What makes a computer, a computer?
        - Computers are everywhere
        - take input, storage, proccessing, and output
        - earliest computers were made out of wood and metal
        - computers used to be very big and slow
        - started out as basics calculators
        - input: 
            - taking input from useres
        - Storage:
            - stores information until ready for output
        Output:
            - text, photos, videos, games, vr
    ## How Computers Work: Binary and Data
        - inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that store the information
        - bit is the smallest piece of information a computer can store
        - more wires = more bits
        - The binary number system
            - only two digits can that can count up to any number (1,0)
            - the numbers are count by multiples of 2
            - with 32 wires you can store up to 4 billion bits
        - Text Binarys
        - Images in binary
            - each image is made by pixels
            - each pixel has a color
        - sound: a series of vibrations
            - more bits means a higher range of numbers


        
    ## How Computers work: Circuits and Logic   
        - a simple circuit take an electric signal and flips it
        - Complicated circuits take multiple signals & combine them to give different results
        - Logic gates 
        - adder: adds two bits together to calcute the sum
        - Smaller circuits computers are faster
    ## How computers work: CPU, Memory, Input & Output
        - Input devices converts physical input into binary information
            - camera, microphone, touchscreen
        - memory: stores information
        - CPU Central processing unit calculates information
        - output: converts information to physical output
            - speaker, robot, car motor, 
            - lets computers interact with the world
    ## How Computers work: Hardware and software
        - Hardware: circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs, stuff
        - software: all the code you dont see
        - CPU: master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
            - circuits that do math and logic
            - circuits that send & recieve
        - Operating System: The master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
        - We make the computers smart
