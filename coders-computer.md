## Choosing a text editor 
  1. Choosing a text editor is a very personal choice.
  1. Allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that allows you to build websites.
  1. Code comlpletion provides a choice, instead of typing and errors occuring.
  1. Allows you to write your *HTML and *CSS more efficiently. 
  1. Short hand language called Emmet.
  1. Extensions are like plug-ins for your text-editor.
  1. There is an text-editor on mac called "text edit".
  1. Make sure text editor is using plain text.
  
  
### Features to look for
  * Code completion
  * syntax highlighting 
  * a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye fatigue)
  * ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions when needed
  
### Third party options
  * Notepad ++ (windows only)
  * Text Wrangler (mac only)
  * BB edit
  * Visual Code Studio
  * Atom Brackets
  * Sublime Text
  
  ## The Command Line
    1. Intro
      * You can have as many terminals open as you want.
    2. What are They Exactly
      * typically a command is the frist thing you type
      * there must be a space between the first command line and command line arguement.
      * next is the output from the command
      * Presents us with a prompt again
    3. The Shell, Bash 
      * Shell is the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave
      * BASH is the most common shell 
      
   ## Basic Navigation
    1. So where are we
      * pwd - print working directory, tells what current directory you are working in
    2. Whats in our current location
      * ls - short for list, list all directories
      * -l shows we are going to do a long listing
      * /etc tells our computer ls not to list our current directory but instead to list that directories contents.
    3. Paths
      * Two types of paths are Absolute and relative 
      * Root directory, it is denoted by a single slash /
      * ~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory
      * . (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory.
      * .. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory.
    4. Lets move around a bit
      * cd, stands for change directory
      * Shortcut - If you run the command cd without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home directory.
      * Shortcut - It's kinda hard to demonstrate here so it's probably best if you try it yourself. If you start typing cd /hTab/<beginning of your username>Tab you'll get a feel for how it works.
   
   ## More about files
    1. linux is an extensionless system
      * file.exe - an executable file, or program.
      * file.txt - a plain text file.
      * file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
     1. Linux is case sensitive
     1. Spaces in names
     1. Quotes 
      * You may use either single or double quotes (later on we will see that there is a subtle difference between the two but for now that difference is not a problem).
      1. Escape Characters
        * Shortcut - In the previous section we learnt about something called Tab Completion. If you use that before encountering the space in the directory name then the terminal will automatically escape any spaces in the name for you.
      1. Is -a, List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
