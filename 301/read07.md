## What Google Learned From Its Quest To Build The Perfect Team
[source](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

- Julia Rozovky wanted to be part of a community, part of something people were building together.
- Study groups carefully engineered by the school to foster tight bonds. Study groups have become a rite of passage at M.B.A. programs, a way for students to practuce working in teams and a reflection of the increasing demand for employees who can adriotly navigate group dynamics.
- Spent beginning of each meeting chatting and joking
- Seems as if people who study together and are genuiely trying to help each other work better than forced study groups.
- Feel like you can say anything to one another
- The bulk of modern work is more and more team-based
- In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studied show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.
- Google embarked on an initiative -- code named Project Aristotle to study study hundred of Google's team and figure out why some stumbled while otheres soared
- Google couldnt find patterns in study or work groups good or bad
- How you treat your teammates matters
- Everyone gets a chance to talk
- good teams had "average social sensitivity"
- Do what you feel is right and be senstive towards others
- The who part of the equation didnt matter
- create safe environments
- if everyone talks everyone learns

## How I explained REST to my brother
[source](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)
- Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the Internet... and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. 
- HTTP, the protocol that he helped write is capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignor for some reason
- HTTP was one of biggest breakthroughs in the history of computing
- REST provides a definition of a "resource", which is what web pages point to.
- URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere
- most cases a resource has only a single representation
- API: machines could use the web just like people do
- URL to tell machines to tell each other things
- Polymorphism: geeky way of saying that different nouns can have the same verb applied
- universal verbs are get put delete
- browser does a HTTP GET on the URL
- you can add, partial update to get data
- software engineers couldnt do their work if it wasnt for RESTful web frameworks like Ruby on Rails
