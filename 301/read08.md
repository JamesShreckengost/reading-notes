# SQLBolt
- To retrieve datat from a SQL database, we need to write a select statement, which are often referred to as queries. 
- A query is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it , and how to trandsform it before it is returned.n
- Think of table in SQL as a type of an entity , and each row in that table as a specific instance of that ype
- the most basic query we could write would be one that slects for a couple columns of the table with all the rows
- The result of this query will be a two-dimensional set of rows and clumns, effectively a copy of the table, but onnly with the columns we requested.
- use * to select all
